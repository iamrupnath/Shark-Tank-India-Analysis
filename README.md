# 📊 Shark Tank India – Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of *Shark Tank India (Season 1)* to understand **deal success factors, negotiation dynamics, and investor behavior**.
The analysis is built using **pure Python analytics tools**, with a strong focus on **business interpretation and visual storytelling**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite national exposure on Shark Tank India, many startup pitches fail to secure funding, while successful deals often differ significantly from founders’ original expectations.
This project aims to identify **what drives deal success**, **how valuations and equity change during negotiations**, and **how sharks differ in their investment behavior**.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**

   * Business-driven framing of the analysis objectives

2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

   * Data type validation
   * Logical consistency checks
   * Feature engineering (deal status, valuation change, equity change, efficiency metrics)

3. **Data Analysis & Insights**

   * Deal conversion analysis
   * Valuation and equity negotiation dynamics
   * Shark-wise investment behavior
   * Capital efficiency and multi-shark deal analysis

4. **Visualization & Dashboards**

   * Multiple dashboard-style visualizations
   * Clean Matplotlib subplots (2×2, 2×3 layouts)
   * Bar charts, line charts, histograms, and pie charts
   * High-resolution saved dashboards

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Only about **half of the pitches** secure a deal.
* **High ask amounts and inflated valuations** significantly reduce deal success.
* Successful deals often involve **valuation cuts and higher equity dilution**.
* Offering **very low equity does not improve deal chances**.
* **Multi-shark deals** increase funding but reduce capital efficiency for founders.
* Sharks exhibit **distinct investment strategies**, from aggressive to selective.
* The best deals maximize **capital raised per unit of equity**, not deal size alone.
